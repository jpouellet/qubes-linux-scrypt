%description
A simple password-based encryption utility is available as a demonstration of
the scrypt key derivation function. On modern hardware and with default
parameters, the cost of cracking the password on a file encrypted by scrypt enc
is approximately 100 billion times more than the cost of cracking the same
password on a file encrypted by openssl enc; this means that a five-character
password using scrypt is stronger than a ten-character password using openssl.
